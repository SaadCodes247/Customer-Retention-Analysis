# Request From Customer Retention Marketing Team

**Manager Responsible:** Eliza Schuyler

**Date Required:**  EOD 23rd July 2025

**Data provided:** Single Customer View of customers over last quarter.
    
### Description:

The retention team would like to use data to inform our decision making. We’d like you
to produce an information presentation deck that we can share with the team to inform
them on the state of play of retentions, with the following:

1. Demographics of churners. What do they look like in terms of gender, age,
family makeup etc and what products do they have? Why are they churning?

2. What factors make a person more likely to stay? We’d like to be able to brief the
new customer team on the best scenario for sign-ups. We can offer an incentive
of $2.50 on one metric for the team, for example they could receive $2.50 for
every customer they sign up on to online-security. What sign up factor should we incentivise?

3. What factors most influence someone churning?
  
4. We have budget for 500 mailers to customers we think are at risk of churning.
Typically we have a 20% uptake rate on the offers in these mailers.
Which customers should we send this to? (please provide list)

5. When talking with a customer, we’d like the customer service team to have an
indication of that person’s churn risk. We’d like the churn likelihood of all of our
remaining customers. (please provide list)

# Output Delivered
  1. Information presentation deck for marketing team with above analysis completed.
  2. Top 500 customers that are most likely to leave to competitors.
  3. All customers and their predicted probabilities of leaving to competitors.
